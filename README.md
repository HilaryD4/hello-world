Just learning the ropes

Hi! I'm Hilary. I'm a left-handed twin who likes to draw animals and trees and lots of other things. I live in San Diego. In high school I learned that I couldn't hear as well as other people my age when the teacher who was in his 40s played a high-pitched sound and all the other students found it painful to hear, meanwhile the teacher and I heard nothing.
